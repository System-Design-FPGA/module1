# Accelerator and Beam Physics Computing Panel

## Mandate

 - The Accelerator and Beam Physics Computing Panel (ABP-CP) is responsible for the software tools for accelerator and beam physics developed in the [BE-ABP](https://be-dep-abp.web.cern.ch) group at [CERN](https://home.cern). It defines the roadmap and provides recommendations for strategic software and hardware choices, in order to fulfill the needs related to:
    1. the operation of CERN accelerators;
    2. upgrade plans (HL-LHC);
    3. design studies for future accelerators.

  - The ABP-CP follows up the development and maintenance of the tools, ensuring an appropriate coordination and prioritization of the activities.

  - It identifies the needs for hardware resources (e.g. batch computing, HPC clusters, GPUs) and coordinates the exploitation of the available computing facilities

  - It liaises with the IT department and external computing centers, concerning the hardware resources and services, and with the controls and operations groups, concerning tools for machine studies and follow-up (e.g. operational displays, data analytics, machine learning).
